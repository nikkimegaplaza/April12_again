# April12_again

I messed up on April12 Repo.
Im watching a git playlist on youtube. I didn't realize the importance of paying attention to what line I was on. the dude did a pull request, but I couldn't; something about "merge conflict" but idk how to fix that other than delete everything. so now I have to start over
